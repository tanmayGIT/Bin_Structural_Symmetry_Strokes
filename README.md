# Document image binarization using structural symmetry of strokes

**I have implemented this following paper here : **
```
Jia, F., Shi, C., He, K., Wang, C., & Xiao, B. (2016). Document image binarization using structural symmetry of strokes. Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR), 2016 15th International Conference On, 411–416.
```

**Although some part of this implementation is taken from the journal version of this conference paper :**
```
Jia, F., Shi, C., He, K., Wang, C., & Xiao, B. (2018). Degraded document image binarization using structural symmetry of strokes. Pattern Recognition, 74, 225–240. 
```

**The following parts are taken from the journal version of this paper (which is supposed to be more robust and better performing)**
```
1) Background image estimation (actually taken from this paper : Ntirogiannis, K., Gatos, B., & Pratikakis, I. (2014). A combined approach for the binarization of handwritten document images. Pattern Recognition Letters, 35(1), 3–15.)
```
2) Image normalization 

3) Gradient image calculation and pixel direction calculation from gradient image

**Then the remaining portion are taken from the above mentioned paper : **
```
Jia, F., Shi, C., He, K., Wang, C., & Xiao, B. (2016). Document image binarization using structural symmetry of strokes. Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR), 2016 15th International Conference On, 411–416.
